# NYC Service Response Time Prediction

This repository contains the code, presentations, and documentation for a predictive model that forecasts response times for NYC service requests. The solution uses predictive analytics to help NYC agencies allocate resources effectively, prioritize critical complaints, and reduce delays.

# Dataset
The dataset used in this project contains 39 million rows and 47 columns, capturing detailed records of NYC 311 service requests. 
Due to its large size, the full dataset is not included in this repository. Instead, it can be accessed via the following link, in the folder named "dataset":
